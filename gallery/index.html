under this year, we had a great crowd and a lot of good
lies introduced.</p><div class=image-full><a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WkhkcOuPBCWDt42QIz9WCtgcFAPIKhhe/view><img src=attendees-thumb.jpg class=image-in-div></a></div><h2 id=plummeting-up>Plummeting Up</h2><div class=image-right><a href=inverted-axis.webp><img src=../images/lie.png class=lie-top-right>
<img src=inverted-axis.webp class=image-in-div width=400px></a></div><p><a href=http://kennethmoreland.com/>Ken Moreland</a> starting things off with an example of one of the most
misleading visualizations accidentally created. This plot shows the number of
gun murders each year in Florida and highlights a time when a &ldquo;stand your
ground&rdquo; law was enacted. A stand your ground law increases the
circumstances in which a citizen is allowed to use deadly force. Advocates
argue that such laws <a href="https://connectusfund.org/17-major-pros-and-cons-of-the-stand-your-ground-law#:~:text=It%20can%20lead%20to%20a%20drop%20in%20crime">lead to an overall drop in crime</a>. This plot seems to
support this argument as there is a sudden drop after the law is created.</p><p>But take a closer look. There is something curious about the vertical axis.
The 0 mark is at the <em>top</em> of the image, and the values go <em>up</em> as you go
<em>down</em> the page. So, the number of murders is not going way down, it is going
way up!</p><p>Since <a href=https://www.businessinsider.com/gun-deaths-in-florida-increased-with-stand-your-ground-2014-2>its construction</a>, this chart has been discussed numerous times <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assholedesign/comments/gvxzs6/just_flip_the_axis_nobody_will_notice/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">on
social media</a> as well as in several blog posts
(<a href=https://www.joeydevilla.com/2014/04/14/lies-damned-lies-and-reuters-graph-of-florida-firearm-deaths-before-and-after-stand-your-ground/>1</a>,
<a href=https://www.livescience.com/45083-misleading-gun-death-chart.html>2</a>,
<a href=https://www.wonkette.com/p/reuters-cool-upside-down-chart-makes-stand-your-ground-look-awesome>3</a>).</p><p>Although misleading, this chart was <a href=https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F74d3cd9d-bed6-4763-b234-52ef99a0974d_980x416.png>created with good intentions</a>. The
concept is that people usually identify up as good and down as bad. More
murders is bad, so the axis was flipped. A <a href=https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2021.3088343>recent published study</a>
investigated this idea. What they found was that although it is easier to
interpret graphs where large values are associated with &ldquo;good,&rdquo; simply
flipping the axis does not work. The confusion of inverted values overrides
any benefit.</p><div class=image-right><a href=upside-down-unemployment.webp><img src=../images/lie.png class=lie-top-right>
<img src=upside-down-unemployment.webp class=image-in-div width=350px></a></div><p>Unfortunately, this plot is not unique in its axis inversion. Here is
another example where the unemployment rate seems to take a big dip during
the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><h2 id=off-by-one-hundred-million-error>Off by One (Hundred Million) Error</h2><div class=image-right><a href=family-housing.webp><img src=../images/lie.png class=lie-top-left>
<img src=family-housing.webp class=image-in-div width=400px></a></div><p>Next, <a href=http://kennethmoreland.com/>Ken</a> found this graph in a <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/REBubble>subreddit about real estate bubbles</a>.
The chart was posted under the provocative title &ldquo;<a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/REBubble/comments/ze5eje/why_isnt_this_one_of_the_biggest_stories_out_there/>Why isn&rsquo;t this one of
the biggest stories out there???</a>&rdquo; At first glance, the chart seems to
justify some scrutiny. The chart shows that since 2007 the number of U.S.
housing units has been going up while the number of families has
gone down leaving a huge gap of apparently empty houses. Bubble indeed!</p><p>However, a closer inspection reveals some problems with this graph. We can
ignore a few things like imprecise numbers and non-zero axes, which are not
dramatic. The <em>really</em> weird thing about this graph is the fact that there
are 2 vertical axes. The blue left axis is labeled &ldquo;Family&rdquo; and the right
axis is labeled &ldquo;Housing Units&rdquo;. Why do these two counts each need their
own axis? And why are they so different? Are there really 144 million
housing units but only 34 million families to put in them? How can there be
over 100 million surplus housing units, and if there were why would we keep
building them?</p><p>The answer lies in the legend. Look carefully and see that the families is
qualified by families that have children under 18 years old. This leaves
out a huge swath of the population. It excludes any adults that do not have
children. It also excludes anyone with grown children (whether or not they
still live with their parents).</p><div class=image-right><a href=households-and-housing.webp><img src=households-and-housing.webp class=image-in-div width=400px></a></div><p>The proper unit to use is <a href=https://wic.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2020/10/Households.pdf>households</a>, which comprises a group of people
living together as one economic unit. The corrected plot here shows the
number of housing units compared to the number of households (now using the
same vertical axis and zoomed in to show detail). We can see that the two
track each other closely. (In fact, there is a slightly smaller surplus of
housing units in 2022 than there was is 2007.)</p><p>So, is the behavior of the family trend in the first graph just noise? No.
This is likely caused by the tendency of <a href=https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2010/04/06/us-birth-rate-decline-linked-to-recession/>birth rates to go down during a
recession</a> as potential parents put off having children for more favorable
conditions, and the recession that started in 2007 was no exception.</p><h2 id=too-many-axes>Too Many Axes</h2><div class=image-right><a href=military-scale.png><img src=../images/lie.png class=lie-bottom-right>
<img src=military-scale.png class=image-in-div width=400px></a></div><p>Speaking of incomparable double y-axes, <a href=http://kennethmoreland.com/>Ken</a> found another strange example
from a <a href=https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2023/jan/military-expenditures-how-top-spending-nations-compare>Federal Reserve blog post</a> (and <a href="https://twitter.com/stlouisfed/status/1617266021810724866?cxt=HHwWhICzlZq41_EsAAAA">subsequent tweet</a>). This plot
shows the total military expenditures from 6 nations. It shows high but
fluctuating US spending and an increasing spending from China that
eventually surpasses everyone. But does it?</p><p>You may notice that there are labels on both the left and right axes. They
do say the same thing, so it’s really just the same axis duplicated to see
the measures better, right?</p><p>Wrong! Look at the scale and see that there are different numbers on each
one. How can the same measure have different values? Once again the answer
is in the legend. The legend label of what each series means also states
which axis, left or right, the series should be read from. In fact, all the
series are on the left axis except the US. You can’t see it with this
display, but the US spending is much larger than any other country.</p><div class=image-right><a href=military-scale-correct.webp><img src=military-scale-correct.webp class=image-in-div width=300px></a></div><p>Here are all the series with the same scaling. It can be seen that the US
spending is far and away from any other country. It is more that 4x larger
than its nearest competitor. This is a story all on itself.</p><p>The original image was clearly constructed this way to demonstrate detail
for all the series. In the corrected plot, all but the top 2 spenders blend
together. However, this is a very confusing way to show this detail. A more
straightforward and clear way is to simply provide a second plot showing
all but the US. In fact, the <a href=https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2023/jan/military-expenditures-how-top-spending-nations-compare>blog post</a> already
has this, making these visual gymnastics completely unnecessary.</p><p>The St. Louis Federal Reserve twitter account updated their tweet to
acknowledge that the plot is problematic. They didn&rsquo;t fix it though. They
just encouraged people to read the blog. I guess that&rsquo;s one way to get
people to read it.</p><h2 id=too-few-axes>Too Few Axes</h2><div class=image-right><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VhG4WpaIwHeVe_g6MJyT02s2kdP-Lu-w/view?usp=sharing"><img src=../images/lie.png class=lie-bottom-right style=right:150px>
<img src=nz-interest-rates-thumb.jpg class=image-in-div></a></div><p>Speaking of the number of vertical axes, <a href=http://kennethmoreland.com/>Ken</a> followed up with this
<a href=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/the-great-divide-why-are-nz-interest-rates-so-much-higher-than-australia/HNNJCCKZV7X4HX3MRAX7WDYWOI/>advertisement for the NZ Herald</a> goes the other way and decides that it
doesn’t need any y axis. This results an interesting chart, but confusing.</p><p>The most confusing part of this chart are the rightmost 2 numbers. Somehow
in this graph, 3.75% is less than 2.61%. That said, this is probably a typo
or copy/paste error from the left side. The actual value is probably close
to 0, but another peril of not having a reference axis means that it is
impossible to tell.</p><p>The typo not withstanding, there is another problem with this chart. The
title does not match the data. The title says, &ldquo;Liam Dann looks at why NZ
interest rates <em>are</em> so much higher than Australia&rdquo; (emphasis ours). But at
the time the data was captured, the interest rates are about the same (and
pretty low). The difference comes from the projected interest rates.
Regardless of how these predictions were made, they are still just
predictions. It is not the state of the current world, and this future may
never come to pass. It is disingenuous to state something exists just
because you think it will eventually happen.</p><h2 id=chicken-vis>Chicken Vis</h2><div class=image-right><a href=chicken-vis.webp><img src=../images/lie.png class=lie-bottom-right>
<img src=chicken-vis.webp class=image-in-div width=350px></a></div><p><a href=https://sites.google.com/site/bernicerogowitz/>Bernice Rogowitz</a> was hungry for vis lies. She started with this
visualization of <a href=https://www.eater.com/2016/9/26/13051528/most-ordered-food-delivery-america>chicken deliveries</a>. The visualization shows a simple
statistic in what is ostensibly a bar chart.</p><p>The decisions of this chart, however, are questionable. Rather than place
the bars on a horizontal line, the entire chart is skewed at an angle,
which makes the whole thing harder to read. The bars helpfully have the
percentage value for each. It is a little weird that the numbers add up to
101%. This is probably a roundoff error, but not very comforting.</p><p>The chart also hits a pet peeve of <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/bernicerogowitz/>Bernice</a>&rsquo;s: why is the &ldquo;other&rdquo; category
so much bigger than the rest? A third of the data is grouped in that other
bar. What is hiding in the big bar?</p><h2 id=when-vis-is-not-a-vis>When Vis is not a Vis</h2><div class=image-right><a href=pie-unchart.webp><img src=../images/lie.png class=lie-top-left>
<img src=pie-unchart.webp class=image-in-div width=350px></a></div><p>Riddle me this, liars: When is a chart not a chart? This is the conundrum
<a href=https://sites.google.com/site/bernicerogowitz/>Bernice</a> faced when she found this visualization on <a href=https://www.aihr.com/blog/data-visualization/>a blog about data
visualization</a>. At first glance, this appears to be a common pie chart
showing six quantities.</p><p>But on closer examination, there are no quantities. What we see are 6
items, but there are no values associated with them. Rather, this is simply
an unordered list of things. When presenting a graphic that clearly
indicates a pie chart, it is confusing to break the metaphors of that
chart. It is particularly ironic that the very graphic is about data
visualization but in fact has no real data visualization.</p><h2 id=more-than-a-whole>More Than a Whole</h2><div class=image-right><a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mXDkmXiK9VyhoIVej9OxstbbaMqOR1kD/view><img src=../images/lie.png class=lie-top-right>
<img src=electorate-pie-chart-thumb.jpg class=image-in-div></a></div><p><a href=https://www.alcf.anl.gov/about/people/joseph-insley>Joe Insley</a> was watching TV when he came across this choice example of a
pie chart. Right away we can see something is suspect when then green wedge
is marked as 58%, but the wedge is clearly less than 50% of the pie.</p><p>So, it comes as no surprise that the proportions add up to more than 100%.
The obvious problem is that this chart breaks the basic metaphor of a pie
chart. These items are not parts of a whole, which makes the pie chart
completely inappropriate. News outlets really seem to like abusing pie
charts like this.
(<a href=https://www.vislies.org/2018/gallery/#helpings-of-pie>Exhibit A.</a>

non-white and female voters might not relate to white male candidates. But
are college-educated white voters particularly resistant to white male
candidates?</p><p>And we are not sure if there is anything to be read into the fact that the
word &ldquo;women&rdquo; has the only lower-case letters on the entire screen.</p><h2 id=who-cuts-a-pie-like-this>Who Cuts a Pie Like This?</h2><div class=image-right><a href=bad-pie-cuts.webp><img src=../images/lie.png class=lie-top-left>
<img src=bad-pie-cuts.webp class=image-in-div width=400px></a></div><p>Back to food, <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/bernicerogowitz/>Bernice</a> presented this pizza pie chart on <a href=https://www.eater.com/2016/9/26/13051528/most-ordered-food-delivery-america>food
deliveries</a>. It is a (literal) pie chart, and the data fits the pie
metaphor of parts of a whole. As an added bonus, the values of the
categories actually add up to 100% this time.</p><p>But something does not look right. If we look at the biggest wedge,
chicken, we expect the wedge to take up 30% of the pie (nearly a third),
but it actually only takes up an eighth.</p><p>Even though the chart is set up both figuratively and literally as a pie
chart, it is not a pie chart. It is not clear how data values are
represented, but they seem to be related to the number of bars emanating
from the center. If we take each bar to mean 3%, that is pretty close to
the actual values listed. However, that is remarkably imprecise. To make
matters worse, the inner bars are much shorter than the outer bars, thus
taking up less area of the screen. This skews the representation to make
big values seem bigger.</p><p>Worst of all, that is a very unappetizing looking pizza.</p><h2 id=an-eye-chart>An Eye Chart</h2><div class=image-right><a href=eye-chart.webp><img src=../images/lie.png class=lie-bottom-right>
<img src=eye-chart-thumb.jpg class=image-in-div></a></div><p><a href=https://sites.google.com/site/bernicerogowitz/>Bernice</a> found this infographic <a href=https://medialibrary.nei.nih.gov/sites/default/files/media-images/NEI-medialibrary-5225027.jpg>from the NIH</a> warning about an expected
increase in macular degeneration. Although the sentiment is worthy, we
identified numerous problems with the graphic.</p><p>We note that the numbers given in the graphic (2.1 million for 2010 and 5.4
million for 2050) are absolute numbers. Sure, the second number is more
than double the first. But if the concerned population proportionally
doubles with it, the chance of a person having the disease does not really
change.</p><p>The chart seems to fix this problem by showing the numbers as a proportion,
but it actually makes the problem worse because the proportions are wrong.
The chart is using the population estimate of 2050 (80 million) for the
proportion of people in 2010. That is just wrong.</p><p>Using a <a href=https://acl.gov/sites/default/files/aging%20and%20disability%20in%20america/2011profile.pdf>proper estimate of people over 65 in the United States in 2010</a>
(40.1 million), the number with macular degeneration was about 5.2%, which
is about twice as large as it appears in the diagram. In contrast, the 2050
estimate, by the numbers provided here, is 6.75%. It is a bit more than
2010, but not nearly as much implied by the graph.</p><div class=image-right><a href=eye-chart-proper-proportions.webp><img src=eye-chart-proper-proportions.webp class=image-in-div width=400px></a></div><p><a href=https://sites.google.com/site/bernicerogowitz/>Bernice</a> proivdes this corrected version of the chart. The proportions are
now much more realistic. As an added cue to the change in the overall
population, <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/bernicerogowitz/>Bernice</a> also adjusted the relative size of the eyes to be
proportional to the concerned population.</p><p><a href=https://sites.google.com/site/bernicerogowitz/>Bernice</a> also notes that although the use of irises as the graphic pie
charts is, shall we say, eye catching, the iris is not where macular
degeneration occurs. Macular degeneration is a condition of the retina on
the inside and the back of the eye.</p><h2 id=representation-matters>Representation Matters</h2><p>VisLies is all about the representation of data and how it can skew the
facts. That is because representation matters, and sometimes subtle changes
make a difference. <a href=https://sites.google.com/site/bernicerogowitz/>Bernice</a> demonstrated this with a <a href=https://doi.org/10.2352/EI.2023.35.10.HVEI-251>recent study</a> that
she briefly summarized. The study showed subjects plots of the same COVID

<img src=tech-layoffs.jpeg class=image-in-div width=400px></a></div><p><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/harith-rathish-912092119/>Harith Rathish</a> encountered this <a href=https://proprietaryreasoning.com/tech-layoffs-federal-reserve-interest-rates/>interactive visualization of technology
layoffs since recent federal interest rate raises</a>, which he found from a
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jtaylorwoodson_techlayoffs-fintech-proptech-activity-7069303950419603456-ODT9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">LinkedIn post</a>. As described in the post, the chart represents a round of
layoffs by a specific company as a bubble. Each bubble is color coded by
subsector and sized by the number of employees let go.</p><p>We found numerous issues with the representation in this diagram. To start,
the size of each layout is represented by area. But area is not a great way
to represent a quantity. Our perception of area does not scale linearly
with area; people tend to underestimate the area of shapes as they grow.
There are methods to <a href=https://makingmaps.net/2007/08/28/perceptual-scaling-of-map-symbols/>compensate for the appearance of area</a>. We cannot
tell if such compensation is used here, but even so the apparent area still
has lots of variability. We recommend avoiding using area to represent
quantities when possible.</p><p>We also find the colors fairly ineffective. Many of the colors are
difficult to distinguish. Granted, with 27 categories it is nigh impossible
to produce easily distinguishable colors. But the problem could be
mitigated by giving similar colors to similar categories. Instead, hues are
simply assigned to an alphabetic list of categories. Consequently, &ldquo;Human
Resources&rdquo; has an almost identical color as &ldquo;Healthcare&rdquo; but is completely
different from other subsectors providing services for businesses like
&ldquo;Logistics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Marketing.&rdquo; The colors would be more effective if related
sectors were grouped with similar colors.</p><p>But the biggest problem with this visualization is that it implies that the
rising interest rates are causing increased technology sector layoffs.
Although the visualization does seem to show a general upward trend of
layoffs, it completely fails to demonstrate this conclusion. It is lacking
in at least three critical ways.</p><p>First, it cannot show that technology layoffs increased after the rate
increases of March 2022 because it does not show the data before
January 2022. Unless you show that there were many fewer layoffs in the
time leading up, you cannot conclude that they have risen.</p><p>Second, the implication that the technology sector was disproportionately
affected is not established. Is this a trend only in the technology sector,
or is it a general economic trend with layoffs happening in many sectors?
Other sectors would have to be shown in comparison.</p><p>Third, and most important, despite what the title says the visualization
does not establish a correlation, let alone a causation, between interest
rates and layoffs. They are just two single events that happened at the
same time. But the title could just have easily said that tech layoffs rose
after Russia began their long invasion of Ukraine or rose after the U.S.
House began investigating Donald Trump&rsquo;s handling of classified documents
or since Florida passed their &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Say Gay&rdquo; education bill. We have no
reason to believe that any of these events are related to tech layoffs, so
why are interest rates necessarily related?</p><h1 id=its-in-our-dna>It&rsquo;s in our DNA</h1><p><a href=https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/cs/people/person/alexandre-kouyoumdjian>Alex Kouyoumdjian</a> brought up a pet peeve of his. Start by Googling images
of DNA. Likely, you will get a search filled with images like these.</p><p><div class=image-inline><a href=https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2021/october/new-gene-editing-technique-offers-scientists-ability-to-turn-on-enzymes-that-cause-dna-mutations><img src=../images/lie.png class=lie-top-left>

<img src=dna-science.jpg class=image-in-div width=30%></a></div></p><p>These images show DNA as squishy, lumpy, or bumpy. They look realistic and
organic, and they often come from what we should consider trustworthy
sources. (These images come from Penn Medicine, the University of Oxford,
and Science, respectively.) They all have the double helix we all know
makes up the shape, but the truth is that these are completely inaccurate
depictions of DNA, and in fact they misrepresent its very nature.</p><div class=image-right><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA><img src=dna-wikipedia.png class=image-in-div></a></div><p>So, what does DNA actually look like? Well, the size of DNA is smaller than
the wavelength of visible light, and so it cannot be seen in the
traditional sense. But DNA is a molecule that can be described in terms of
the atoms it comprises, as shown here. Note how different this structure is
from the images above. Even those bumpy images that might be comprised of
spheres are constructed in no way related to the actual configuration of
DNA. Sure, the representation of a molecule can take some creative
liberties of what it &ldquo;looks&rdquo; like, but the underlying configuration should
be correct.</p><p>To be clear, there is no problem with simplifying the representation or
using symbolic notation. Both are done on this good example here to help
understand the structure of the molecule. The problem comes from these
hi-res, detailed, and realistic-looking pictures that people could easily
mistake for electron microscopy and think, &ldquo;Wow, I&rsquo;ve never seen such
detailed images of DNA before. Who knew it looked like that?&rdquo; Well, it
doesn&rsquo;t, and we expect better from medical and biology publications that
know this.</p><h1 id=picking-rotten-cherries>Picking Rotten Cherries</h1><div class=image-left><a href=cherry-picking-climate.webp><img src=../images/lie.png class=lie-top-right>
<img src=cherry-picking-climate-thumbnail.webp class=image-in-div></a></div><p>Wow&mldr; We&rsquo;ve seen plenty examples of cherry picking at VisLies, but have we
ever seen anything as brazen as this? It&rsquo;s one thing to cheat the data by
picking only those items that support your narrative, but it is another to
show how you cherry picked the data among the rest of the data that
completely invalidates your point.</p><p>To make it clear what is wrong here, ignore the obtrusive straight red line
Steve Milloy has drawn across the graph. The graph shows the average global
temperature as measured in the lower atmosphere. The blue dots are the
measurements for each month. As to be expected with any weather-related
measurements, there is a lot of noise and fluctuation from month to month.
There is a second red line smoothing out the data to give a better
indication of longer trends. In any case, it is clear to see that the
values on the left side of the graph are generally lower than those on the
right.</p><p>Despite the clear indication that the data shows the opposite of what he
wants to say, Steve Milloy picks two specific measurements that suit him
and throws away the rest. These two points are not representative of the
rest of the data. The first measurement, from December 1987, is a complete
anomaly being warmer than any other measurement in over 10 years either
way. The slope of the connecting line has nothing to do with the trends of
the collective data.</p><p>This is one of those times where we know a VisLie was intentionally created
to mislead people. We&rsquo;re sure Steve Milloy can&rsquo;t be that stupid.</p><p>Well, pretty sure.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
